For instance, my on-going work is to study interactions between jets and hydrodynamic flows in QGP.\nTypically, computer simulation and statistical analysis are what we use in such problems. And recently, we find machine learning methods can sometimes give inspirations as well. But the disadvantage is clear: the results are often hard to interpret and thus unconvincing. So I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to find ways to solve complex-system problems with machine learning with absence of the interpretability difficulty.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://royess.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"In modern physics, with more and more fundamental laws of nature accurately obtained, a new chanllge is how to study a complex system, i.e., a many-body problem.\n\u0026ldquo;More is different\u0026rdquo; by P.
