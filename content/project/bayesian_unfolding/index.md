title: "Bayesian Unfolding on HIC-based Data"
summary: "Work with Sitian. The motivation is to apply Bayesian unfolding on data in heavy ions collisions experiment, in order to eliminate the smearing effects from statistic error. In the project, the data are generated by priori distribution, which is multi-dimensional. Some simple *de-correlation* models are introduced to simulate the effects in HIC."
