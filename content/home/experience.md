  Worked in a team to participant in [Student Cluster Competition](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/) in SC19. The competition is about setting up a high-performace cluster and running applications on it. I engaged in the following two scientific applications:
  * [Vector Particle-In-Cell (VPIC)](https://github.com/lanl/vpic) for modeling kinetic plasmas in electromagnetic field.
  * [Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST)](https://github.com/sstsimulator) for simulating current and future computer system designs.
