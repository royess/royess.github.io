      <description>&lt;p&gt;In modern physics, with more and more fundamental laws of nature accurately obtained, a new chanllge is how to study a complex system, i.e., a many-body problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;More is different&amp;rdquo; by P. W. Anderson is a famous comment on complex system, which indicates new physics will &lt;em&gt;emerge&lt;/em&gt; with the complexity growing up. To study a complex systems, we cannot directly apply first-principle laws at least due to numerical limitations. Instead, phenomenological model from experiments is workable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest is the physics in complex systems. For instance, my on-going work is to study interactions between jets and hydrodynamic flows in QGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, computer simulation and statistical analysis are what we use in such problems. And recently, we find machine learning methods can sometimes give inspirations as well. But the disadvantage is clear: the results are often hard to interpret and thus unconvincing. So I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to find ways to solve complex-system problems with machine learning with absence of the interpretability difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
